# AUR packages

Update `sable-bin` and `sable-nightly-bin` through your AUR helper.
In-app updates are disabled because Electron's Debian installer bypasses pacman.

## Upgrading older packages

Older packages created launcher symlinks outside pacman's file list. The first
upgrade may fail with `/usr/bin/sable exists in filesystem` (or
`/usr/bin/sable-nightly`). Remove the old package and reinstall:

```sh
sudo pacman -R sable-bin
paru -S sable-bin
```

Use `sable-nightly-bin` for nightly. This removes the old launcher and preserves
your account data and settings.

If another package depends on Sable, remove only the launcher after checking
that `pacman -Qo` reports it as unowned and its target is `/opt/Sable/sable`
(nightly: `/opt/Sable Nightly/sable-nightly`). Then retry the upgrade.

## Packaging

CI generates the PKGBUILD and `.SRCINFO` with the release version and checksum.
The package owns its launcher; pacman hooks refresh desktop and icon caches.
`desktop-file-utils` is also needed for per-user deep-link registration.
The bundled Chromium sandbox must be owned by root with mode `4755`.
